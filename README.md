# PyGA
Genetic algorithm implementations in Python.

### Usage

Run `genlearn.py` with Python 3 or pypy for better performance. 

All parameters, including the target string, population size and mutation rate are specified on lines `138-140`. Method `run()` is used for launching the algorithm with the specified parameters.

Additionally, `genpixel.py` can be used for images represented by ASCII characters (visually, as in ASCII art). Filename of the input image is set on line `188`, where the image is converted into an ASCII string.
